Our formatting standard is BSD-style braces, 3-space indent for blocks,
no indent for namespaces. otherwise it's fairly standard - no spaces
between a function and its (, one space between if/while and its (, no
spaces after ( or before ). generally spaces either side of =, +, -,
etc... unless it's more readable without.
