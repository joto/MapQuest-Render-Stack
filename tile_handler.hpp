 *
 * this could be done by reading the worker's configuration, however

/* handler main loop object.
 *
 * mongrel2 only provides HTTP protocol support, it delegates most of
 * the work of figuring out what the requests mean to 'handler'
 * processes, which run outside of the mongrel process, possibly even
 * on another computer.
 *
 * this handler deals with requests for tiles. it communicates with a
 * storage object to figure out whether that tile exists already and
 * with a distributed rendering queue to render it if not.
 *
 * the handler routes messages between three processes; mongrel2, the
 * storage object and the distributed rendering queue. these other
 * processes may do work, but the handler effectively does none other
 * than routing the messages. this is by design, so that the handler
 * is able to spend as much time as possible in its event loop,
 * reducing the latency for messages to be appropriately routed.
